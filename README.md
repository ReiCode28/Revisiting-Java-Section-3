# Booleans And Conditionals

Here I revisit the Java Fundamentals that I previously learned at Zip Code Wilmington coding bootcamp:  

<b>Controlling how code runs using Booleans and Conditionals</b>

- Booleans
- If statements
- Switch statements
- Delimiters

In the end, I practice what I've learned by creating a simple dealership application to make sure that I completely understand Booleans and Conditionals.



<b>Dynamic Dealership Application</b>

Interactive dealership application that allows a client to buy and sell a car. Used switch statements to let users choose from a list of options
Used If-else to control how dealership reacts to user input.

Logic for buying a car:
- Checks clients budget
- Checks clients insurance, license and credit score
- If requirements are met, client can buy the car

Logic for selling a car:
- Selling price is lower than the car's value
- Selling price is lower than $30,000
- If requirements are met, dealership will buy the car
